## Objective
The main goal of this project is to get experience in the developement using a variety of softwares, using professional design patterns, to make a reasonable presentation for future software developement oppertunities.

## Additional information
The project used for these projects is inspired by a project developed in a Software Developement course I took at University. This is just an inspiration and will NOT share any code from that project. The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/overlappd-com/overlappd-prod) and an older version of the same project [here](https://github.com/overlappd-com/overlappd).
